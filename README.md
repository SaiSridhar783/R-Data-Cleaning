CONTENT
-------

The repository contains all the files provided by coursera and the files created after completing the assignment, main ones being - 

1.  README.md (the current file) explains the content of each main file

2.  the tidyData.txt is a tidy data set that has the mean and standard deviation for each measurments with the subject ID and the activities performed

3.  run\_analysis.R is a R script that does the following:

-   merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
-   extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
-   uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-   labels the data set with descriptive variable names
-   creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
